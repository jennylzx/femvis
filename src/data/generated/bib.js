        "abstract": "Social and political factors structure how data are collected, analyzed, and visually presented. Visualization researchers are increasingly discussing these issues, and calling for feminist approaches that allow not only for the interrogation of unspoken assumptions and power imbalances in how visualizations are designed and deployed, but also for the creation of new systems by and for marginalized groups. This paper describes the motivation, ideation, and prototyping of a novel visualization tool to support voice training for transgender people. We centered our design around user needs and lived experiences, in order to support self-determination of gender expression. In so doing, we make novel inroads into how to visualize speech data, and open possibilities for future work in the design of visualizations that prioritize user agency within social and political contexts.",

        "abstract": "A common research process in visualization is for visualization researchers to collaborate with domain experts to solve particular applied data problems. While there is existing guidance and expertise around how to structure collaborations to strengthen research contributions, there is comparatively little guidance on how to navigate the implications of, and power produced through the socio-technical entanglements of collaborations. In this paper, we qualitatively analyze reflective interviews of past participants of collaborations from multiple perspectives: visualization graduate students, visualization professors, and domain collaborators. We juxtapose the perspectives of these individuals, revealing tensions about the tools that are built and the relationships that are formed --- a complex web of competing motivations. Through the lens of matters of care, we interpret this web, concluding with considerations that both trouble and necessitate reformation of current patterns around collaborative work in visualization design studies to promote more equitable, useful, and care-ful outcomes.",

        "abstract": "A growing body of work draws on feminist thinking to challenge assumptions about how people engage with and use visualizations. This work draws on feminist values, driving design and research guidelines that account for the influences of power and neglect. This prior work is largely prescriptive, however, forgoing articulation of how feminist theories of knowledge --- or feminist epistemology --- can alter research design and outcomes. At the core of our work is an engagement with feminist epistemology, drawing attention to how a new framework for how we know what we know enabled us to overcome intellectual tensions in our research. Specifically, we focus on the theoretical concept of entanglement, central to recent feminist scholarship, and contribute: a history of entanglement in the broader scope of feminist theory; an articulation of the main points of entanglement theory for a visualization context; and a case study of research outcomes as evidence of the potential of feminist epistemology to impact visualization research. This work answers a call in the community to embrace a broader set of theoretical and epistemic foundations and provides a starting point for bringing feminist theories into visualization research.",

        "abstract": "The measurements of ``success'' in networked social media do not render visible the actual importance of \\#MeToo or the broader phenomenon of structural sexual violence. In crucial ways, the structure of \\#MeToo is not a network. If we insist on mapping \\#MeToo as a network -- the all-encompassing symbol of digital society -- we risk missing fundamental elements of the movement that don't answer to the network analogy. The arbitrary and heavily mediated frame of the 280-character tweet, and Twitter's ``rich- get- richer'' network effects, amplify some voices at the expense of others. Mainstream white media are central while ethnic media are minor. White women celebrities are central while Black and Indigenous advocates are marginalized. Since Tarana Burke founded the movement in 2006, its goal has been to break the silence around sexual violence and uplift the voices of survivors. But what happens when the platform works against hearing those voices?",

        "abstract": "Recent developments in critical information visualization have brought the field's attention to political, feminist, ethical, and rhetorical aspects of data visualization. However, less work has explored the interplay between design decisions and political ramifications---structures of authority, means of representation, etc. In this paper, we build upon these critical perspectives and highlight the political aspect of civic text visualization especially in the context of democratic decision-making. Based on a critical analysis of survey papers about text visualization in general, followed by a review on the status quo of text visualization in civics, we argue that civic text visualization inherits an exclusively analytic framing. This framing leads to a series of issues and challenges in the fundamentally political context of civics, such as misinterpretation of data, missing minority voices, and excluding the public from decision making processes. To span this gap between political context and analytic framing, we provide a series of two-pole conceptual dimensions, such as from singular user to multiple relationships, and from complexity to inclusivity of visualization design. For each dimension, we discuss how the tensions between these poles can help surface the political ramifications of design decisions in civic text visualization. These dimensions can thus help visualization researchers, designers, and practitioners attend more intentionally to these political aspects and inspire their design choices. We conclude by suggesting that these dimensions may be useful for visualization design across a variety of application domains, beyond civic text visualization.",

Using insights developed by critical algorithm and critical archival studies, it analyzes how JSTOR's topics repeatedly misrepresent and erase work in women's, African diasporic/African American, and Native American and settler colonial histories. The article discusses concerns over the power of metadata, the need for transparent and domain-expert-involved indexing processes, and digital providers' responsibilities to accurately categorize scholars' work. It particularly focuses on the potentially disproportionate harm done to traditionally marginalized fields of study through seemingly racist or sexist topical labeling that impedes knowledge discovery.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a Mechanical Turk study that explores how the most common words that have been used to refer to people in recent HCI literature are received by non-experts. The top five CHI 2014 people words are: user, participant, person, designer, and researcher. We asked participants to think about one of these words for ten seconds and then to draw an image of it. After the drawing was done we asked simple demographic questions about both the participant and the created image. Our results show that while generally our participants did perceive most of these words as predominately male, there were two notable exceptions. Women appear to perceive the terms \"person\" and \"participant\" as gender neutral. That is, they were just as likely to draw a person or a participant as male or female. So while these two words are not exactly gender neutral in that men largely perceived them as male, at least women did not appear to feel excluded by these terms. We offer an increased understanding of the perception of HCI's people words and discuss the challenges this poses to our community in striving toward gender inclusiveness.",

We show how a feminist approach explores political dimensions in data and turns data visualization into a tool of subversion and resistance against the systems of oppression, in an unequal society like the Chilean. The reflections in this article seek to create dialogue around the question of how data visualization can be transformed into a tool of non-oppression and liberation, from a feminist approach. In line with this, the first part of the article provides a brief contextualization of the political and ethical attributes of data visualization. Then, we reflect on a framework that allows us to understand it as a feminist tool. We will finally delve into the ODEGI case and our use of data visualization to contribute to the fight against patriarchy and other systems of oppression, giving concrete examples of the categories of analysis we use in our design and decision processes.",

However, providing this kind of information may also have negative, unintended consequences, such as biasing readers' interpretations, a loss of trust as a result of too much transparency, and the possibility of opening visualization creators with minoritized identities up to undeserved critique. To help future visualization researchers and practitioners decide what kinds of metadata to include, we discuss some of the potential benefits and risks of disclosing five kinds of metadata: metadata about the source of the underlying data; the cleaning and processing conducted; the marks, channels, and other design elements used; the people who directly created the visualization; and the people for whom the visualization was created.

        "abstract": "We present an analysis of the representation of gender as a data dimension in data visualizations and propose a set of considerations around visual variables and annotations for gender-related data. Gender is a common demographic dimension of data collected from study or survey participants, passengers, or customers, as well as across academic studies, especially in certain disciplines like sociology. Our work contributes to multiple ongoing discussions on the ethical implications of data visualizations. By choosing specific data, visual variables, and text labels, visualization designers may, inadvertently or not, perpetuate stereotypes and biases. Here, our goal is to start an evolving discussion on how to represent data on gender in data visualizations and raise awareness of the subtleties of choosing visual variables and words in gender visualizations. In order to ground this discussion, we collected and coded gender visualizations and their captions from five different scientific communities (Biology, Politics, Social Studies, Visualisation, and Human-Computer Interaction), in addition to images from Tableau Public and the Information Is Beautiful awards showcase. Overall we found that representation types are community-specific, color hue is the dominant visual channel for gender data, and nonconforming gender is under-represented. We end our paper with a discussion of considerations for gender visualization derived from our coding and the literature and recommendations for large data collection bodies.

In order to understand how they affect film and media studies, this article reflects on databases in the context of feminist film historiography. Focusing on the collaborative Women Film Pioneers Project (WFPP) (https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/), it considers the methodological matters when presenting and accessing research results online. One of the biggest challenges for film and media historians today is not only to retrieve and preserve historic sources but also to make both historical records and research outcomes accessible, while taking into account the ``unknowability'' of history. How can we identify and include the many blind spots when trying to reconstruct the past? In this article, it is made the case that due to their openness and variable use, digital databases, such as the Women Film Pioneers Project, seem to be perfectly suited to respond to this challenge.",

Other technology- and design-oriented fields such as Science and Technology Studies, Human-Computer Interaction, Digital Humanities, and Geography/GIS have begun to incorporate feminist principles into their research. Feminism is not (just) about women, but rather draws our attention to questions of epistemology -- who is included in dominant ways of producing and communicating knowledge and whose perspectives are marginalized. We describe potential applications of feminist theory to influence the information design process as well as to shape the outputs from that process.",

        "abstract": "As digital humanists have adopted visualization tools in their work, they have borrowed methods developed for the graphical display of information in the natural and social sciences. These tools carry with them assumptions of knowledge as observer-independent and certain, rather than observer co-dependent and interpretative. This paper argues that we need a humanities approach to the graphical expression of interpretation. To begin, the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed. Next, the forms for graphical expression of capta need to be more nuanced to show ambiguity and complexity. Finally, the use of a humanistic approach, rooted in a codependent relation between observer and experience, needs to be expressed according to graphics built from interpretative models. In summary: all data have to be understood as capta and the conventions created to express observer-independent models of knowledge need to be radically reworked to express humanistic interpretation.",

        "abstract": "Based on a collaborative visualization design process involving sensitive historical data and historiographical expertise, we investigate the relevance of ethical principles in visualization design. While fundamental ethical norms like truthfulness and accuracy are already well-described and common goals in visualization design, datasets that are accompanied by specific ethical concerns need to be processed and visualized with an additional level of carefulness and thought. There has been little research on adequate visualization design incorporating such considerations. To address this gap we present insights from Topography of Violence, a visualization project with the Jewish Museum Berlin that focuses on a dataset of more than 4,500 acts of violence against Jews in Germany between 1930 and 1938. Drawing from the joint project, we develop an approach to the visualization of sensitive data, which features both conceptual and procedural considerations for visualization design. Our findings provide value for both visualization researchers and practitioners by highlighting challenges and opportunities for ethical data visualization.",

        "abstract": "Intersectional bias is a bias caused by an overlap of multiple social factors like gender, sexuality, race, disability, religion, etc. A recent study has shown that word embedding models can be laden with biases against intersectional groups like African American females, etc. The first step towards tackling intersectional biases is to identify them. However, discovering biases against different intersectional groups remains a challenging task. In this work, we present WordBias, an interactive visual tool designed to explore biases against intersectional groups encoded in static word embeddings. Given a pretrained static word embedding, WordBias computes the association of each word along different groups like race, age, etc. and then visualizes them using a novel interactive interface. Using a case study, we demonstrate how WordBias can help uncover biases against intersectional groups like Black Muslim Males, Poor Females, etc. encoded in word embedding. In addition, we also evaluate our tool using qualitative feedback from expert interviews. The source code for this tool can be publicly accessed for reproducibility at github.com/bhavyaghai/WordBias.",

Myriad factors such as editorial policies, news sensationalism, election cycles, societal priorities, and political agendas can all impact the attention given, and treatment of, a range of important societal issues such as systematic disadvantage. Here, we introduce and describe `Discourse of the Past', an interactive visualisation created for both public touch-screen exhibition and online. The visualisation presents an AI-assisted analysis of hundreds of thousands of op-ed news articles and speeches from the major Australian mastheads and federal parliament respectively. By focusing on 23 population groups and 33 issues, we provide a rich, dynamic picture of how disadvantage is experienced in Australia and by whom. Users can discover a series of findings, such as: how News and Parliament have their own agenda and how each changes its focus over time; how some issues are more recurrent than others; how coverage and discourse intensity change relative to cycles and events; and how both discourses contribute to a better understanding of how disadvantage is lived in Australia.",

Despite a plethora of devices and data, however, users' views of their own health are often fragmented. This is a problem for women's health, where physical and mental observations and symptoms are strongly intertwined. An integrated view throughout different life stages could help to better understand these connections, facilitate symptom alleviation through life-style changes, and support timely diagnosis: currently, women's health issues often go under-researched and under-diagnosed. To capture the needs and worries of self-directed tracking, interpreting and sharing women's health data, we held workshops with 28 women. Drawing upon feminist methods, we conducted a Reflexive Thematic Analysis to identify six central themes that ground opportunities and challenges for life-long, self-directed tracking of intimate data. These themes inform the design of tools for data collection, analysis and sharing that empower women to better understand their bodies and demand adequate health services.",

        "abstract": "Although recent research acknowledges the potential of visualization methods in digital humanities (DH), the predominant terminology used to describe visualizations (prototypes and tools) focuses on their use as a means to an end and, more importantly, as an instrument in the service of humanities research. We introduce the sandcastle as a metaphorical lens and provocative term to highlight visualization as a research process in its own right. We argue that building visualization sandcastles provides a holistic approach to cross-disciplinary knowledge generation that embraces visualization as (1) an aesthetic provocation to elicit critical insights, interpretation, speculation, and discussions within and beyond scholarly audiences, (2) a dynamic process wherein speculation and re-interpretation advance knowledge within all disciplines involved, and (3) a mediator of ideas and theories within and across disciplines. Our argument is grounded in critical theory, DH, design, human--computer interaction, and visualization, and based on our own research on an exceptional literary collection. We argue that considering visualizations as sandcastles foregrounds valuable insights into the roles of visualization as a mindset, methodology, and praxis within humanities research and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Implicit biases and stereotypes are often pervasive in different forms of creative writing such as novels, screenplays, and children's books. To understand the kind of biases writers are concerned about and how they mitigate those in their writing, we conducted formative interviews with nine writers. The interviews suggested that despite a writer's best interest, tracking and managing implicit biases such as a lack of agency, supporting or submissive roles, or harmful language for characters representing marginalized groups is challenging as the story becomes longer and complicated. Based on the interviews, we developed DramatVis Personae (DVP), a visual analytics tool that allows writers to assign social identities to characters, and evaluate how characters and different intersectional social identities are represented in the story. To evaluate DVP, we first conducted think-aloud sessions with three writers and found that DVP is easy-to-use, naturally integrates into the writing process, and could potentially help writers in several critical bias identification tasks. We then conducted a follow-up user study with 11 writers and found that participants could answer questions related to bias detection more efficiently using DVP in comparison to a simple text editor.",

In this workshop, data workers chose a topic of their interest, sourced and processed data on that topic, and used that data to create presentations. Drawing from discourses of data literacy; epistemic agency and lived experience; and critical race theory, we analyze the workshops' activities and outcomes. Through this analysis, three themes emerge: the tensions between epistemic agency and the context of work, encountering the ordinariness of racism through data work, and understanding the personal as communal and intersectional. Finally, critical race theory also prompts us to consider the very notions of data literacy that undergird our workshop activities. From this analysis, we offer a series of suggestions for approaching designing data literacy activities, taking into account critical race theory.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents discursive patinas, a technique to visualize discussions onto data visualizations, inspired by how people leave traces in the physical world. While data visualizations are widely discussed in online communities and social media, comments tend to be displayed separately from the visualization and we lack ways to relate these discussions back to the content of the visualization, e.g., to situate comments, explain visual patterns, or question assumptions. In our visualization annotation interface, users can designate areas within the visualization. Discursive patinas are made of overlaid visual marks (anchors), attached to textual comments with category labels, likes, and replies. By coloring and styling the anchors, a meta visualization emerges, showing what and where people comment and annotate the visualization. These patinas show regions of heavy discussions, recent commenting activity, and the distribution of questions, suggestions, or personal stories. We ran workshops with 90 students, domain experts, and visualization researchers to study how people use anchors to discuss visualizations and how patinas influence people's understanding of the discussion. Our results show that discursive patinas improve the ability to navigate discussions and guide people to comments that help understand, contextualize, or scrutinize the visualization. We discuss the potential of anchors and patinas to support discursive engagements, including critical readings of visualizations, design feedback, and feminist approaches to data visualization",

        "abstract": "The trouble with data is that it frequently provides only an imperfect representation of a phenomenon of interest. Experts who are familiar with their datasets will often make implicit, mental corrections when analyzing a dataset, or will be cautious not to be overly confident about their findings if caveats are present. However, personal knowledge about the caveats of a dataset is typically not incorporated in a structured way, which is problematic if others who lack that knowledge interpret the data. In this work, we define such analysts' knowledge about datasets as data hunches. We differentiate data hunches from uncertainty and discuss types of hunches. We then explore ways of recording data hunches, and, based on a prototypical design, develop recommendations for designing visualizations that support data hunches. We conclude by discussing various challenges associated with data hunches, including the potential for harm and challenges for trust and privacy. We envision that data hunches will empower analysts to externalize their knowledge, facilitate collaboration and communication, and support the ability to learn from others' data hunches.",

This free-form medium has a long history and has been used as means for personal or intimate expression, as a way for marginalized people to describe issues that are important to them, and as a venue for graphical experimentation. It would seem then that zines would make an ideal vehicle for the recent interest in applying feminist or humanist ideas to visualization. Yet, there has been little work combining visualization and zines. In this paper we explore the potential of this intersection by analyzing examples of zines that use data graphics and by describing the pedagogical value that they can have in a visualization classroom. In doing so, we argue that there are plentiful opportunities for visualization research and practice in this rich intersectional-medium.",

We conducted a two-year design study focused on the creation of a community-based data display using the United States Environmental Protection Agency data on water permit violations by oil storage facilities on the Chelsea Creek in Massachusetts to explore whether situated data physicalization and Participatory Action Research could support meaningful engagement with open data. We selected this data as it is of interest to local groups and available online, yet remains largely invisible and inaccessible to the Chelsea community. The resulting installation, Chemicals in the Creek, responds to the call for community-engaged visualization processes and provides an application of situated methods of data representation. It proposes event-centered and power-aware modes of engagement using contextual and embodied data representations. The design of Chemicals in the Creek is grounded in interactive workshops and we analyze it through event observation, interviews, and community outcomes. We reflect on the role of community engaged research in the Information Visualization community relative to recent conversations on new approaches to design studies and evaluation.",

        "abstract": "A good data visualization opens up space for good conversations. That is, a data visualization is a starting point in a discussion of a shared understanding of the world, a way for us to know together. Consequently, our practices as data visualization designers-through collecting data and portraying them visually-create (or reinforce) ways we can understand the world, and thus move through it-it's ontological. Alarmingly, there is an emerging sense among new media artists and scholars that our practices of collecting and visualizing data can create rigid, harmful understandings of the world; ontologies of control. In particular, D'Ignazio and Klein argue in their book, Data Feminism, that our current practices of data science can lead to the ``silencing, extraction, monetization, or invisibility'' of people (or other living things) that the data represent [9]. In response to this violence, they assert that we need to make visible those who are creating the data, and those who are represented by the data. In other words, we need to ``bring back the bodies.'' This research interrogates how we might recenter the embodied, situated nature of data through the design of Tsuga Convictio, an experimental data collection process and a data visualization to support the conversations critical to our future-the reflective community conversations that help us belong to our human and ecological communities. By designing for these conversations, we discovered fluid, feminine, and embodied ways to create-and (re)enchant data visualizations. Along the way, we begin to answer some of the fundamental questions designers implicitly (and explicitly) answer when they make data visualizations. Most profoundly, we (re)imagine what visualizations can do-data visualizations are more than just tools of control; they are tools for imagination and transformation.",

Taking up the question of what intersectional feminist data visualization looks like, this chapter situates the stakes of intersectional feminist data visualization, discusses why it is critical now, and offers five precepts for undertaking it to more fully realize the power of data visualization for multiply minoritized communities. Unlike theory and digital humanities, with their specialized language that is challenging to those who are not steeped in academic discourse, data visualization is unique in its producers and audiences. Data visualization is a method that crosses over between academy and industry, between scholar and practitioner, between professional and amateur.",

The academic visualization community has produced a large body of work for reporting on design studies, informed by a handful of theoretical frameworks, and applied to a broad range of application areas. The result is an abundance of reported insights into visualization design, with an emphasis on novel visualization techniques and systems as the primary contribution of these studies. In recent work we proposed a new, interpretivist perspective on design study and six companion criteria for rigor that highlight the opportunities for researchers to contribute knowledge that extends beyond visualization idioms and software. In this work we conducted a year-long collaboration with evolutionary biologists to develop an interactive tool for visual exploration of multivariate datasets and phylogenetic trees. During this design study we experimented with methods to support three of the rigor criteria: ABUNDANT, REFLEXIVE, and TRANSPARENT. As a result we contribute two novel visualization techniques for the analysis of multivariate phylogenetic datasets, three methodological recommendations for conducting design studies drawn from reflections over our process of experimentation, and two writing devices for reporting interpretivist design study. We offer this work as an example for implementing the rigor criteria to produce a diverse range of knowledge contributions.",

        "abstract": "We present the results of a scientometric analysis of 30 years of IEEE VIS publications between 1990-2020, in which we conducted a multifaceted analysis of interdisciplinary collaboration and gender composition among authors. To this end, we curated BiblioVIS, a bibliometric dataset that contains rich metadata about IEEE VIS publications, including 3032 articles and 6113 authors. One of the main factors differentiating BiblioVIS from similar datasets is the authors' gender and discipline data, which we inferred through iterative rounds of computational and manual processes. Our analysis shows that, by and large, inter-institutional and interdisciplinary collaboration has been steadily growing over the past 30 years. However, interdisciplinary research was mainly between a few fields, including Computer Science, Engineering and Technology, and Medicine and Health disciplines. Our analysis of gender shows steady growth in women's authorship. Despite this growth, the gender distribution is still highly skewed, with men dominating ({\\textbackslash}approx{$\\approx$} 75\\%) of this space. Our predictive analysis of gender balance shows that if the current trends continue, gender parity in the visualization field will not be reached before the third quarter of the century ({\\textbackslash}approx{$\\approx$} 2070). Our primary goal in this work is to call the visualization community's attention to the critical topics of collaboration, diversity, and gender. Our research offers critical insights through the lens of diversity and gender to help accelerate progress towards a more diverse and representative research community.",

Manually generating a fair consensus ranking is time-consuming and impractical- even for a fairly small number of candidates. While algorithmic approaches for auditing and generating fair consensus rankings have been developed, these have not been operationalized in interactive systems. To bridge this gap, we introduce FairFuse, a visualization system for generating, analyzing, and auditing fair consensus rankings. We construct a data model which includes base rankings entered by rankers, augmented with measures of group fairness, and algorithms for generating consensus rankings with varying degrees of fairness. We design novel visualizations that encode these measures in a parallel-coordinates style rank visualization, with interactions for generating and exploring fair consensus rankings. We describe use cases in which FairFuse supports a decision-maker in ranking scenarios in which fairness is important, and discuss emerging challenges for future efforts supporting fairness-oriented rank analysis.

Since sex/gender categories cannot convey nonbinarity and multiplicity, this project addresses the inherent tension between queerness and systematisation with an anticategorical quantitative visual approach, combining psychometric scales with visualisations of the gender spectrum. Indeed, using queer and feminist methodologies, we propose a new data structure resulting from the codesign of an interactive visualisation of the gender spectrum, made in an iterative dialogue with gender-diverse people. Our contribution is twofold: an inclusive data structure for the self-assessment of sex/gender identity, and an interactive visualisation, acting as a critical design object, educational and counselling tool, and basis for data collection, annotation, and analysis. Although this project could both empower and harm sexual minorities, its originality is seeing nonbinarity and multiplicity not as appendices to a normative system, but as queering design principles.",

        "abstract": "Transcription, annotation, digitization and/or visualization are common transformations that historical documents such as national records, birth/death registers, university records, letters or books undergo. Reasons for those transformations span from the (physical) protection of the original materials to disclosure of 'hidden' information or patterns within the documents. Even though such transformations bring new insights and perspectives on the documents, they also modify the documents' content, structure, and/or artifactual form and thus, occlude prior knowledge and interpretation. When it comes to visualization as a means to transform historical documents from written to abstract visual form, there is typically little acknowledgment or even understanding of the previous transformation steps these documents have gone through. The 'tremendous rhetorical force' of visualization, we argue, should not be at the expense of the multiple pasts, contexts, and curators that are inherent in historical record collections. Rather, the urgent question for the fields of visualization and the (digital) humanities is how to better support awareness of these multiple layers of interpretation and the people behind them when representing historical documents. We begin to address this question based on a collection of historical university records by (a) investigating common transformation processes of historical documents, and (b) discussing opportunities and challenges for making such transformations transparent through what we call 'provenance-driven visualization'; the idea for a visualization that makes visible the layers of transformation (including interpretation, re-structuring, and curation) inherent in historical documents.",

        "abstract": "Open Sonifications is a manifesto for a more inclusive approach to data sonification. The practice of turning data into sound is dominated by approaches that prioritise analysis and algorithmic sound synthesis. This pictorial expands the boundaries of what is considered sonification by challenging existing conventions around what we can do with sonification, who gets to use sonification, why we sonify, what counts as valid data or valid sound, and the tools used to make sonifications. Alongside conventional sonification values such as insight and accuracy, we also value raw energy, expressiveness, polyphony, participation, decentralisation, performance, accessibility, approachability, community, and plurality of perspectives. The approaches we describe do not seek to replace established methods, but to enrich them. We contribute a set of values, examples and instructions for joining this movement, and reflections on how people working beyond sonification might benefit from these ideas.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new approach to the visualization design and communication process, literate visualization, based upon and extending, Donald Knuth's idea of literate programming. It integrates the process of writing data visualization code with description of the design choices that led to the implementation (design exposition). We develop a model of design exposition characterised by four visualization designer architypes: the evaluator, the autonomist, the didacticist and the rationalist. The model is used to justify the key characteristics of literate visualization: `notebook' documents that integrate live coding input, rendered output and textual narrative; low cost of authoring textual narrative; guidelines to encourage structured visualization design and its documentation. We propose narrative schemas for structuring and validating a wide range of visualization design approaches and models, and branching narratives for capturing alternative designs and design views. We describe a new open source literate visualization environment, litvis, based on a declarative interface to Vega and Vega-Lite through the functional programming language Elm combined with markdown for formatted narrative. We informally assess the approach, its implementation and potential by considering three examples spanning a range of design abstractions: new visualization idioms; validation though visualization algebra; and feminist data visualization. We argue that the rich documentation of the design process provided by literate visualization offers the potential to improve the validity of visualization design and so benefit both academic visualization and visualization practice.",
